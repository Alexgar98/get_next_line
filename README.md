# get_next_line
get_next_line is a code-efficient function to read stuff from a file descriptor passed as the argument; each time the function is called will read a new line until reaching a newline character. "Code-efficient" means that I had a limit of only two .c files, which per Norminette equals to 10 functions, including the main one, of at most 25 lines each.

<h3>Things to improve:</h3>
There might be better, less complicated, more code-efficient ways to make this function work as intended and which I might try in a future. Might also try the bonus part in a distant future.
